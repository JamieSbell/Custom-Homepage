# Custom-Homepage
This is the most up to date version of my custom homepage project. I rebuilt everything from scratch since I really didn't like using Bootstrap. I'm focusing on funtionality first, then I'll make it pretty. 

Currently broken because I was rewriting the code again. I'm gonna fix it and hopefully not break it again.
